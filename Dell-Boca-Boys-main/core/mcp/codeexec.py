Code Execution MCP
-------------------

This module exposes a sandboxed code execution service that can be used as
part of the Multi‑Component Platform (MCP).  Inspired by the Manus
platform's ability to execute arbitrary code snippets across multiple
languages, the CodeExec MCP provides a controlled environment for running
short programs and returning their output to callers.  It currently
supports Python scripts and is designed to be extensible to other
languages in the future.

The core API is provided by the ``execute`` function which accepts
parameters describing the language, the code to run, optional
arguments and a timeout.  Execution is performed in a separate
process using Python's ``asyncio`` facilities to avoid blocking the
event loop.  Temporary files are used to hold the script and are
deleted after execution completes.  Outputs are captured and
returned as strings along with the exit status and a flag
indicating whether the execution timed out.

Security Considerations
=======================

Running arbitrary code carries inherent risk.  The following
mechanisms mitigate some of these risks in this demonstration:

* **Isolated process** – Code runs in its own subprocess rather
  than in the main application interpreter.  This prevents it
  from modifying in‑memory state of the service.
* **Temporary working directory** – Execution occurs within a
  transient temporary directory created for each run.  No access
  to the parent file system is provided, though the host
  operating system's restrictions still apply.
* **Timeout** – A hard timeout ensures runaway scripts are
  terminated.  The default is five seconds but can be overridden
  per request.

In a production deployment you would further containerise
execution (e.g. via Firecracker or gVisor), drop privileges and
restrict system calls to limit what code can do.  You would also
integrate this service with the Policy MCP to redact PII or deny
execution based on content of the code or its output.

Usage example::

    from core.mcp.codeexec import execute

    result = await execute(language="python", code="print('hello')")
    print(result["stdout"])  # prints "hello\n"
