Knowledge MCP
-------------

This module provides a simple implementation of the Knowledge MCP.
It exposes three primary functions:

* ``init_db`` – create the underlying SQLite database schema if it
  does not exist.  Called at application startup.
* ``ground`` – given a query and a logical space, return a summary
  answer, supporting evidence and coverage metrics.  Uses naive
  keyword overlap ranking over the stored documents.  In a
  production system this would be backed by a vector database and
  semantic search; here we opt for a transparent scoring approach.
* ``writeback`` – persist a list of document changesets into the
  knowledge store, capturing lineage via the provided fields.  This
  allows downstream corrections to be stored for future retrieval.
* ``snapshot`` – retrieve all documents within a particular space.

Documents are stored with the following fields:

* ``id`` – auto‑incrementing primary key
* ``space`` – namespace or tenant label (e.g. ``"crm"``, ``"finance"``)
* ``content`` – unstructured text containing the evidence
* ``created_at`` – ISO‑8601 timestamp indicating when the document
  was recorded

All functions accept an optional ``path`` argument to override the
location of the SQLite database.  The default is ``"knowledge.db"``
relative to the current working directory.

Note: this implementation is intentionally synchronous for
simplicity.  In a concurrent server environment you should use
connection pooling or an async driver (e.g. ``aiosqlite``).  The
naive similarity metric should be replaced with a proper semantic
search mechanism such as pgvector, Qdrant or Milvus, as suggested in
the architecture overview.
