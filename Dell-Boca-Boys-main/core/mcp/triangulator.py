Triangulator MCP
----------------

This module implements a simple Triangulator MCP responsible for routing
tasks across multiple models, adjudicating their outputs and
self‑checking results.  It is designed to be agnostic of the models
themselves: models are registered as callables that accept a ``task``
string and return an ``output`` string along with metadata.  Each
candidate produced by a model is captured as a :class:`Candidate`.

The primary functions are:

* ``route`` – dispatch a task to a specified list of models under
  latency and cost budgets.  Returns a list of candidates.
* ``adjudicate`` – choose a winning candidate given a set of rubric
  criteria.  Rubrics consist of named criteria with weights and
  evaluation functions.  A simple scoring scheme is provided.
* ``self_check`` – compute a quality score for a single output using
  rudimentary heuristics (e.g. checking for non‑empty output, absence
  of obvious PII).

In a production system this module would integrate with a routing
layer such as LiteLLM or LangGraph to handle model selection, load
balancing and retries.  The adjudicator could leverage external
evaluation frameworks such as RAGAS or DeepEval.  Here we implement
a deterministic yet extensible version suitable for demonstration and
testing.
