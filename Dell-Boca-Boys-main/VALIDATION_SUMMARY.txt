The n8n-agent-dell-bocca-vista component demonstrates:
  ✓ Excellent architectural vision and design
  ✓ Strong implementation of core learning system
  ✓ Working prototype of multi-agent orchestration
  ✓ Comprehensive documentation and planning
  
But requires:
  ✗ Code reorganization (empty component directory)
  ✗ Completion of N8n integration (critical gap)
