| Dependency conflicts | Medium | Medium | Lock versions, test compatibility |
| Database schema overlaps | Medium | Low | Use namespaced tables, Alembic migrations |
| Integration complexity | High | Medium | Phased approach, feature branches |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Benchmark each phase, optimize queries |

### Timeline Risks:

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Underestimated effort | High | Add 20% buffer, prioritize ruthlessly |

| Scope creep | Medium | Strict phase boundaries, defer nice-to-haves |

### Rollback Strategy:
- Each integration in separate feature branch
- Can abandon any integration without affecting others
- Maintain working main branch throughout
